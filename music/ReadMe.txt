VGM Compressor (vgm_cmp)
--------------
This tool can greatly reduce the size of a VGM by stripping unneccessary commands. Delays are also highly optimized.
The file size of compressed files usually decreases to 50-60% (Sega Master System with YM2413) or 15-40% (NeoGeo Pocket).

Usage: vgm_cmp [-justtmr] Input.vgm [Output.vgm]
If you insert the argument "-justtmr", vgm_cmp will only strip commands that can't affect the playback in any way.

Notes:
- The tool resets its internal data at the Loop Offset to make loops safer.
- Although there is a loss of data, a sample-by-sample comparison results in the exactly same output. (verified with T6W28, YM2413, YM2612, RF5C68, AY8910, YMF271, YMF262, YMZ280B, Y8950)
- NEVER use this tool on untrimmed files. Trimming will NOT work vgm_trim.
- Nevertheless it can be useful to use this tool with -justtmr on (a copy of) an untrimmed file.


Make VGM Frame Accurate (vgm_facc)
-----------------------
Does what is says - it rounds all delays to frames.
You can set the Frame Rate with VGMTool ("Playback rate").
All rates are accepted as long as a can be rounded to whole samples (44100 % Rate = 0).

Systems where you want to do this are:
- Sega Master System
- Sega Game Gear

It's not recommended to do this with rips of these systems:
- Sega MegaDrive/Genesis (especially the ones that use the DAC)
- NeoGeo Pocket (Color)
- MAME systems

After a conversion is finished, the rounding statistics are displayed. They show the maximum rounding errors (OldSample - RoundedSample). 
Line 1: Left Error [always negative or 0]
Line 2: Right Error (all but 1st frame)
Line 3: Right Error (1st frame only)
The 3rd line is included, because initialisation can take many commands and takes more time than the rest of a song.
If the value of the first and/or the second line is quite high (e.g. >= 300 for 60 Hz) a frame accurate conversion is a bad idea.

Note: Even delays of 65535 samples are rounded. (e.g. to 65415 for 60 Hz)


Remove 1 Sample Delays (vgm_smp1)
----------------------
This tool helps to reduce the size of VGMs by removing delays of 1 sample length.
Example:
	Delay 12 - Event A - Delay 1 - Event B - Delay 5
is rounded to
	Delay 12 - Event A - Event B - Delay 6
This is especially useful for NeoGeo Pocket VGMs.
It's not recommended for Sega MegaDrive/Genesis VGMs - it may destroy the DAC sound.

Note: If you remove samples from VGMs compressed with vgm_cmp you should run vgm_cmp again. It may reduce the file size by some bytes.


VGM Splitter (Delay Edition, vgm_sptd)
------------
This tool splits a vgm file into smaller pieces. This is useful if you record many songs to one file (e.g. in MAME or MESS).
It splits after a certain delay which you have to enter after the filename. It's given in samples, 1 second has 44100 samples in VGMs. (default is 32768)
The delay where a file is split is stripped, so you shouldn't have any silence at the beginning or end of the file.

Note: Sometimes it seems to produce some empty files if you use delay values >= 65536, but all others should be bug-free.


VGM Splitter (Sample Edition, vgm_spts)
------------
This tool splits a vgm file into smaller pieces. This is useful if you record many songs to one file (e.g. in MAME or MESS).
The difference to the tool above is, that you have to enter the sample where you want to split the file. Entering 0 (simply pressing enter without typing has the same effect) closes the program.
The delay where a file is split is stripped, so you shouldn't have any silence at the beginning or end of the file.

Notes:
- To get the last part of the vgm, you need to enter -1, as 0 will close vgm_spts instantly.
- The "current sample" value can be higher than the sample value that was entered previously. That's nothing unusual because it won't split inside a delay.
- The commandline can be used like this: "vgm_spts Stream.vgm 44100 176400 0". It will then split at sample 44100 and 176400 and will end the program. Without the zero at the end it will wait for another input.


VGM Trimmer (vgm_trim)
-----------
This is a simple vgm trimmer. It's recommended to use it if you have a completely clean loop (e.g. one found with the VGM Loop Finder).
You will be asked for a file name and three sample positions.

Start Sample:	the 1st sample of the new VGM file (default: 0)
Loop Sample:	sample to which the VGM loops back (default: 0)
		Special Values:
			 0 - Looping off
			-1 - Loop from Start Sample (you must use this if Start Sample is 0)
			-2 - Keep old Loop Point (if there was no loop there will be no loop)
End Sample:	sample, where the VGM ends or loops back (default: 0, data of this sample is killed if EndSample < TotalSamples)
		Special Values:
			 0 - actually not a special value, but can be used to cancel trimming
			-1 - use Total Samples-Value

In order to make a safe but optimized trimming, the following commands are rewritten:
- PSG: NoiseMode (Reg 0xE?) / GG Stereo
- YM2612: LFO Frequency (Reg 0x22) / Ch 3 Mode (Reg 0x27) / DAC Enable (Reg 0x02B)
- YM2203: Ch 3 Mode (Reg 0x27)
- YM2608: LFO Frequency (Reg 0x22) / Ch 3 Mode (Reg 0x27) / ADPCM Volume (Reg 0x011) / Delta-T Volume (Reg 0x10B)
- YM2610: LFO Frequency (Reg 0x22) / Ch 3 Mode (Reg 0x27) / ADPCM Volume (Reg 0x101) / Delta-T Volume (Reg 0x01B)
- YM3812/YM3526/Y8950: Wave Select (Reg 0x01) / CSM/KeySplit (Reg 0x08)
- YMF262/YMF278B: Wave Select (Reg 0x01) / CSM/KeySplit (Reg 0x08) / OPL3/4 Mode Enable (Reg 0x105) / 4-Ch-Mode (Reg 0x104)
- Y8950: Delta-T Volume (Reg 0x12)
- YMZ280B: Key On Enable (Reg 0xFF)
- YMF271: Group Registers (Reg 0x600 - 0x60F)
- [Note: And some more. Still need to fix the ReadMe]

Commandline Usage: vgm_trim [-state] Input.vgm StartSmpl LoopSmpl EndSmpl [Output.vgm]
If you insert the argument "-state", vgm_trim will put save state of all used chips at the beginning of the VGM.
You can use this, if the instruments don't want to sound right even with silence at the beginning.

Notes:
- It's possible to add silence to a file by setting Start Sample < 0 or End Sample > TotalSamples.
- Unlike VGMTool there's NO data added to make safe loops. This makes files smaller, but you have to find the right loop point. (vgmlpfnd may like your game :) )
- There can be problems at the beginning of a vgm due to stripped commands, but usually music engines send enough commands or even spam the chips so that should be no problem.
  If this is still a problem, please contact me and I'll implement a mode that can simulate VGMTool's way of trimming.
- "-state" is not yet supported for all chips.


VGM Text Writer (vgm2txt)
---------------
This tool converts a VGM to a text file.
It's not as good as the vgm2txt of VGMTool (it doesn't print note names or frequencies), but supports VGM version 1.60 and almost all current chips.

Notes:
- unsupported are: YM2413, ADPCM/DELTA-T-part of OPN chips (YM2203, YM2608, YM2610/B), DELTA-T-part of Y8950, WaveTable-part of YMF278B, YMF271, many VGM 1.61 chips
- note names are supported for YM2151, because of the way the chip works.


VGM Loop Finder (vgmlpfnd)
---------------
This tool can be a big help if you search for loop points.
It searches for blocks that match exactly, but have a different position in the file. Delays are ignored to make things possible.

After opening a file and entering a Step Size (higher values speed things up, lower ones are more accurate), and another 2 values there is a display like this:

     Source Block	      Block Copy	   Copy Information
Start	End	Smpl	Start	End	Smpl	Length	Cmds	Samples

It searches for matching blocks, so there's a "Source Block" and a "Block Copy". Each block has a start and end position (byte-values in hex) and also a sample start position. "Copy Information" shows the block length in bytes ("Length"), commands ("Cmds") and samples ("Samples").
If "Source Block: End" is greater than "Block Copy: Start" or at least equal: congratulations - you have found the loop. But don't forget to check the length of your loop, else you might cut the tune.
Then you can copy the sample values to a VGM Trimming tool of your choice - "Source Block: Smpl" as Loop Point and "Block Copy: Smpl" as End Point. (In this case vgm_trim should work well.)

Sometimes there are some letters shown before the "Source Block: Smpl"-Value.
- "e" is an incomplete loop, that was terminated by an EOF
- "f" is a full loop (but didn't last to the EOF)
- "!" is a full loop that's terminated by an EOF - you've found the optimal loop!

While searching, you can press "Pause" to pause the search. (Press any other key to continue.) And you can press Ctrl + C to close the program.
I'm sure you WANT to do this if your file is big.

Successfully tested with:
- Sega Master System (YM2413)
- OutRun on MAME (YM2151)
- MSX Computers (YM2413 and YMF278)
- Sega MegaDrive/Genesis (YM2612, with DAC used too)

There's absolute no way to use it with:
- NeoGeo Pocket (T6W28, the sound engine is weird)

Some music engines that use the SN76496 or T6W28 seem to shuffle the order of commands sometimes.
Music engines with dynamic channel allocation (like GEMS on MegaDrive) make it impossible to find loops.
Multi-chip-systems also may not work very well.


To speed the search and make it possible to find loops the following commands are ignored:
- timer registers in general
- YM2612 DAC write
- RF5Cxx Memory write
- PWM Channel write
- Data Block (comparing isn't needed)


Notes:
- Searching can take a very long time, because it searches very many times through the whole file.
- Although the display may be a little confusing at the beginning, it can greatly reduce the time you need to make a vgm pack.


DRO to VGM Converter (dro2vgm)
--------------------
This tool converts dro files (DosBox RAW OPL) to vgm.
These dro-versions are supported:

Version	DosBox	Rease Date
   0	 0.61	 4 Jul 2004
   1	 0.63	18 Nov 2004
   2	 0.73	14 Jul 2008

Note: The program may print a warning about incorrect delays. That's caused by old dro-files (v0 and v1) because of the way DosBox logs them. The program already HAS a detection to detect and fix some of these bugs, so most files should work.


VGM Sample-ROM Optimizer (vgm_sro)
------------------------
Like vgm_cmp, this tool can greatly reduce the size of a VGM. It strips unused data from Sample-ROMs.
The file size of optimized files usually decreases to 5-10%.

Before any data is stripped, vgm_sro will display all ROM Regions. So you can see what data is stripped.

The following chips need a Sample-ROM:
- SegaPCM
- YM2608 (DELTA-T)
- YM2610 (ADPCM and DELTA-T)
- Y8950 (DELTA-T)
- YMZ280B (Sample ROM)
- RF5C68 (if not streamed)
- RF5C164 (if not streamed)
- YMF271

Notes:
- If a vgm-file doesn't use one of these chips, vgm_sro can't do anything and will refuse to process the file.
- YM2610 ADPCM only: If many ROM Regions have a length of 100 or vgm_sro complains about "end out of range" 
(and wants to use the complete ROM), you may want to try vgm_sro_adpcm1. This is a patch that avoids a bug of "Puzzle De Pon!".
- SegaPCM support isn't 100% safe. That means, that there may be stripped off, although they're used. That can 
happen between 2 memory writes that relocate the  playing address and shouldn't be audible.



VGM RF-PCM Optimizer (optvgmrf)
--------------------
If you know optvgm, you know what optvgmrf does. (Internally it works completely different, but the result is the same.)
This tool optimized VGM files, that use PCM chips of the RF-family (RF5C68 and Sega MegaCD's RF5C164).
The file size of optimized files usually decreases to 5-10%.

The resulting output-file will be updated to vgm v1.60.


VGM Merger (vgmmerge)
----------
This small tool merges two (or more) vgms into one.
That's it. Really. You can use it e.g. to combine 2 mid2vgm files to get YM2413 + YM2612.

Usage: vgmmerge [-f:#] [-nodual] Input1.vgm Input2.vgm [Output.vgm]
-f:#	merge # files (default is 2)
-nodual	disables generating dual-chip vgms when two vgm with the same chip are merged [because generating dual-chip vgms isn't yet supported, this is always on]

Note: You can get quite many warnings if you merge multiple vgms with the same chips, but different chip attributes (e.g. clocks).


General Notes
-------------
- Almost all inputs can also be given through the command line.
- No tool will overwrite an original file, unless you specify an output-filename that matches the input-filename.
  By default the resulting file has always the name "sourcefile_something.vgm", but will be overwritten without any question.
- The resulting files are always uncompressed vgm-files. (vgz files will be decompressed.)
- Using the VGM Compressor should be the last step before tagging.
- Handling of 0x8? commands should work and was tested but I'm not 100% sure it'll always work correctly.
- Most tools don't check if a file was changed during the process. A tool may output the file without changing anything.
- All tools wait for a keypress at end, if there're called with an absolute path. So they don't close instantly when double-clicked.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some parts of this file are outdated. Many of the VGM v1.61 features, as well as some newer tools aren't mentioned.
